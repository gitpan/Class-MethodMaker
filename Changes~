Revision history for Perl extension Class::MethodMaker.

0.92  Added regression tests, originally written to exercise 0.91 and
      then moved to a restructured MethodMaker.pm. One meta-method,
      fields() was abandoned, and replaced with a different meta_method,
      grouped_fields(), which adheres to the new calling structure.

0.91  Bundled up in a proper package, released to CPAN 26 November 1996

0.90  First stab -- released to CPAN without proper Makefile.PL or
      anything.
