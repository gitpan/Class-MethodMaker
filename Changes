Revision history for Perl extension Class::MethodMaker.

0.94  Added static_get_set, and hashref arg handling to hash & 
      static_hash; all courtesy of Matthew Persico.  Slight cleaning.
      Added more ideas to `TODO' list.

0.93  Documentation update.  Various bug fixes.  Added object list
      (courtesy of Evolution Online Software).  Update get_concat to
      utilize a join field.  Remove some undocumented code.  Added
      tie_hash type.  Update tests, add in some for new types, remove
      tests for undocumented features.  Released March 2000.

0.92  Added regression tests, originally written to exercise 0.91 and
      then moved to a restructured MethodMaker.pm. One meta-method,
      fields() was abandoned, and replaced with a different meta_method,
      grouped_fields(), which adheres to the new calling structure.

0.91  Bundled up in a proper package, released to CPAN 26 November 1996

0.90  First stab -- released to CPAN without proper Makefile.PL or
      anything.
