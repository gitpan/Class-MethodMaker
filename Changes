	- Correction to -java flags for get_set (to use set_* rather than

0.96  Wed Jun  7  6:13AM GMT 2000
	- Fix pre-5.005_03 breakage.
	- Undeprecate get_set->clear_x (keep it for consistency), since all

	- Add in (experimental) copy method.

0.95  Thu Jun  1  8:12PM GMT 2000
	- Fix bug in boolean that failed in inherited classes.
	- Make get_set (undef) work.  Deprecate clear_x.
	- -sugar reintroduced for backward compatibility only.

0.94  Thu May 11  6:19AM GMT 2000
	- Added static_get_set, and hashref arg handling to hash &
	  static_hash; all courtesy of Matthew Persico.  Slight cleaning.

0.93  Tue May  9  8:34AM GMT 2000
	- Documentation update.  
	- Various bug fixes.  
	- Added object list (courtesy of Evolution Online Software). 
	- Update get_concat to utilize a join field. 
	- Remove some undocumented code.  
	- Added tie_hash type. 
	- Update tests, add in some for new types, remove tests for
	  undocumented features.

0.92  Added regression tests, originally written to exercise 0.91 and
      then moved to a restructured MethodMaker.pm. One meta-method,
      fields() was abandoned, and replaced with a different meta_method,
      grouped_fields(), which adheres to the new calling structure.

0.91  Bundled up in a proper package, released to CPAN 26 November 1996

0.90  First stab -- released to CPAN without proper Makefile.PL or
      anything.
