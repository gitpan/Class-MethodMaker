Module Class-MethodMaker (1.12):

Description:

    This module solves the problem of having to write a bazillion get/set
    methods that are all the same.  The argument to 'use' is a hash whose
    keys are the names of types of generic methods generated by MethodMaker
    and whose values tell method maker what methods to make.  More
    precisely, the keys are the names of MethodMaker methods (methods that
    write methods) and the values are the arguments to those methods.

Modules & Classes Provided:

    Class::MethodMaker - a module for creating generic methods
