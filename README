Module Class-MethodMaker:

    a module for creating generic methods

Description:

    This module solves the problem of having to write a bazillion
    get/set methods that are all the same. The argument to 'use' is a
    hash whose keys are the names of types of generic methods generated
    by MethodMaker and whose values tell method maker what methods to
    make. (More precisely, the keys are the names of MethodMaker methods
    (methods that write methods) and the values are the arguments to
    those methods.
